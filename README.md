This project is made based on the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9l1zUfnZkZkPSxOWpRF9rlE00j7mtPEo

## Setting up Spring Boot application.

1. Make sure you have installed Java. For development OpenJDK 17 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) should be used.
2. Install Intellij IDEA Commmunity edition
3. Import the Maven project
4. Run the FriendsApplication from IDE.

## Setting up Angular application.

To get Angular app up and running you need to:

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18+ installed.
2. Open the terminal.
3. Navigate to frontend project `cd frontend/`
4. Install all dependencies with npm `npm install`. NB: This might take a while.
5. Start the development server `npm run start`.
   Frontend runs on port 4200, so make sure it's not in use.
6. Once development server is running, open app at http://localhost:4200.<br> 
   If you can see a picture of friends then it means that you have sucessfully set up and run the application
